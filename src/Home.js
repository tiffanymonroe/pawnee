                <h4>Knife Safety</h4>
                <p>Many people have questions about Pawnee‚Äôs Byzantine Knife-Carry codes. Here‚Äôs a quick and easy guide.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>3-inch foldable blades are acceptable, if sheathed in a leather case with a secure lock-back mechanism.</li>
                  <li>Flip-knives, butterfly knives, switchblades, and spring-loaded knives are permissible if and only if hidden in boots or secured to ankles.</li>
                  <li>4-inch to 14-inch blades require permit and proof that owner feels threatened and needs said knife for reassurance.</li>
                  <li>Sword canes and other blades disguised as ordinary objects (walker spears, umbrella shivs, backpack axes, prosthetic leg machetes, and fake-soda-can knives) are allowed.</li>
                  <li>Beginning 10/01/09, Chinese throwing stars are legally classified as ‚Äútoys‚Äù and must be painted bright, child-friendly colors.</li>
                  <li>Cuisinart blades cannot be used outside of their Cuisinarts. This means you, Councilman Howard! <span role="img" aria-label="smiley">üôÇ</span></li>
